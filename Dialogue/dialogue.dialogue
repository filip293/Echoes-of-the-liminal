[center]John: [center]Hey, Mr. Potatoman, do you think I’m a good husband?
[center]Mr. Potatoman: [center]Yeah, John, I think any woman would be lucky to be with you!

[center]John: [center]Then why did she kick me out again?
[center]Mr. Potatoman: [center]Probably because you came home smelling like a distillery and tried to serenade her with a spaghetti spoon.

[center]John: [center]Fair point… but now I’m stuck in the middle of this creepy forest. Why am I even heading to the cabins?
[center]Mr. Potatoman: [center]You said something about proving your love. Or maybe it was finding a “magic pizza slice.” You weren’t exactly clear.

[center]John: [center]Right! If I show her I can survive out here, maybe she’ll see I’m serious and take me back. Where are these cabins anyway?
[center]Mr. Potatoman: [center]Oh, they’re just behind me. You’ll see signs on the trees.

[center]John: [center]Okay, thanks, buddy. You’re always looking out for me.
[center]Mr. Potatoman: [center]Speaking of looking out... do you hear that behind you?[/center]

[center]John: [center]Hello? Anybody home...? Feels wrong.
[center]John: [center]Feels like everyone just... evaporated. Where'd they go?
